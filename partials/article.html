        <h1>The Value of Money</h1>
            <p>Most economists are in agreement that the inflation in the United States during the past three years has been the worst since the early 1940′s, taking account of both severity and duration. But they cannot agree on the nature of the inflation that is engulfing the American economy. To some, inflation denotes a spectacular rise in consumer prices; to others, an excessive aggregate demand; and to at least one economist, it is the creation of new money by our monetary authorities. This disagreement among economists is more than an academic difference on the meaning of a popular term. It reflects professional confusion as to the cause of the inflation problem and the policies that might help to correct it. A review of some basic principles of economics that are applicable to money may shed light on the problem.Two basic questions need to be answered: What are the factors that originally afforded value to money, and What are the factors that effect changes in the “objective exchange value of money” or its purchasing power</p>
            <p>Money is a medium of exchange that facilitates trade in goods and services. Wherever people progressed beyond simple barter, they began to use their most marketable goods as media of exchange. In primitive societies they used cattle, or measures of grain, salt, or fish. In early civilizations where the division of labor extended to larger areas, gold or silver emerged as the most marketable good and finally as the only medium of exchange, called money. It is obvious that the chieftains, kings, and heads of state did not invent the use of money. But they frequently usurped control over it whenever they suffered budget deficits and could gain revenue from currency debasement.When an economic good is sought and wanted, not only for its use in consumption or production but also for purposes of exchange, to be held in reserve for later exchanges, the demand for it obviously increases. We may then speak of two partial demands which combine to raise its value in exchange—its purchasing power.</p>
            <p>People seek money because it has purchasing power; and part of this purchasing power is generated by the people’s demand for money. But is this not reasoning in a vicious circle?It is not! According to Ludwig von Mises’ “regression theory,” we must be mindful of the time factor. Our quest for cash holdings is conditioned by money purchasing power in the immediate past, which in turn was affected by earlier purchasing power, and so on until we arrive at the very inception of the monetary demand. At that particular moment, the purchasing power of a certain quantity of gold or silver was determined by its nonmonetary uses only.</p>

        <h1>What is a GMO?</h1>
            <p>A GMO (genetically modified organism) is the result of a laboratory process where genes from the DNA of one species are extracted and artificially forced into the genes of an unrelated plant or animal. The foreign genes may come from bacteria, viruses, insects, animals or even humans. Because this involves the transfer of genes, GMOs are also known as “transgenic” organisms. This process may be called either Genetic Engineering (GE) or Genetic Modification (GM); they are one and the same. Read more.In your food! First introduced into the food supply in the mid-1990s, GMOs are now present in the vast majority of processed foods in the US. While they are banned as food ingredients in Europe and elsewhere, the FDA does not even require the labeling of GMOs in food ingredient lists.</p>
            <p>Although there have been attempts to increase nutritional benefits or productivity, the two main traits that have been added to date are herbicide tolerance and the ability of the plant to produce its own pesticide. These results have no health benefit, only economic benefit.Currently commercialized GM crops in the U.S. include soy (94%), cotton (90%), canola (90%), sugar beets (95%), corn (88%), Hawaiian papaya (more than 50%), zucchini and yellow squash (over 24,000 acres).Products derived from the above, including oils from all four, soy protein, soy lecithin, cornstarch, corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup among others. There are also many “invisible ingredients,” derived from GM crops that are not obviously from corn or soy.
            </p>
            <p>Genetically modified foods have been linked to toxic and allergic reactions, sick, sterile, and dead livestock, and damage to virtually every organ studied in lab animals. The effects on humans of consuming these new combinations of proteins produced in GMOs are unknown and have not been studied. See more under GMO Health Risks.
            Crops such as Bt cotton produce pesticides inside the plant. This kills or deters insects, saving the farmer from having to spray pesticides. The plants themselves are toxic, and not just to insects. Farmers in India, who let their sheep graze on Bt cotton plants after the harvest, saw thousands of sheep die!Herbicide tolerance lets the farmer spray weed-killer directly on the crop without killing it. Comparative studies on the toxic residues in foods from such crops have not yet been don</p>

        <h1>Welcome 2100</h1>
            <p>The good news about 2010 is that the world will emerge from recession and the post-crisis economic landscape will become clearer. Less cheerful is what that landscape will look like. The rich world, burdened by debt and high unemployment, faces a long, hard slog. Governments will confront difficult decisions on how fast to start withdrawing the huge support they provided to keep the financial system going. Voters will vent their anger when given the chance at the polls—kicking out Labour in Britain in May and perhaps even depriving Barack Obama of a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives in America's mid-term elections in November. Businesses will hardly feel much better, but they can at least begin to focus on strategies for future growth, rather than tactics for short-term survival.</p>
            <p>Those strategies will place an increasing emphasis on emerging markets, many of which will power ahead. India will mark an historic transition: manufacturing will at last outweigh farming. It and other emerging giants will also make their presence felt in the G20, now the pre-eminent club for global decision-making. The presidents of three of these countries—Indonesia, Russia and South Africa—offer their views on 2010 in this edition.China will be central to just about every global issue in the coming year, from the economy to climate change and nuclear diplomacyThen there's China. It is identified as central to just about every global issue in the coming year, from the economy to climate change and nuclear diplomacy; it is becoming, with America, an “indispensable nation”. In 2010 not only will China once again host big, eye-catching events (after Beijing's Olympics in 2008 it will be Shanghai's turn, with its World Expo expected to draw 70m visitors, and Guangzhou hosts the Asian Games). It will also reach two statistical landmarks: it will overtake Japan to become the world's second-largest economy; and it will arrive at the peak of its “demographic dividend”, after which its dependency ratio of young and old to people in work will rise. Whether China, with its multiple growing pains, proves to be a relaxed power or a prickly one will be a central issue for 2010 and beyond.</p>
